    <b>Effective date May 16, 2008</b><br><br> Welcome to RareShare.org ("RareShare")! We are built on a premise that sharing information is good, especially when it comes to information about rare diseases. The more you share the more you have an opportunity
    to help others whose lives have been touched by rare disease. Since rare diseases are not common, they are also often not well understood. By joining our community of support and sharing information about your experience, you will help others, including
    researchers, better understand your disease.<br><br> Below are the Terms of Service, and in the right column, you will find a summary that will help you understand these terms, although the summary is not legally binding.<br><br> The following terms
